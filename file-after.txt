Staying Safe After a Space Weather Event:
-----------------------------------------
Knowing how to react after a disaster is as important as knowing how to act 
during one. Here are a few things you can do while waiting for authorities to 
provide further directions.

1) Don't assume the danger has passed. Follow all federal, state, or local 
directions until authorities say otherwise.

2) Throw out meat and dairy that exceeded 40*F or more for over 2hrs.

3) Throw out any foods that appear to be unusual in color, texture, or odor. 
When in doubt, throw it out!

4) Do not assume foods/drinks are safe just because they appear to be safe.

5) Frozen foods, including meat and dairy products, can be safely refrozen if 
it never exceeded 40*F. Use a food thermometer to be sure.

6) If you unplugged appliances or flipped breakers to 'off', plug cords in and 
flip breakers to 'on' one at a time to avoid overload.

7) Allow water to run from taps for 3+ minutes if water was disrupted.

8) Keep data use and phone calls to a minimum as satellite-based systems may 
still be unstable.

9) Remember, this guidance is applicable to many types of natural disasters 
besides harmful space weather!
