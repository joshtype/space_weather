Staying Safe During Space Weather Events:
-----------------------------------------
Knowing how to act during a space weather event or other natural disaster 
can help you and your household, as well as your community, stay safe.

1) Keep electricity usage as low as possible to help power companies avoid 
   imposing rolling blackouts.

2) Follow all directions broadcast from Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless
   Emergency Alerts (WEA), NOAA Weather Radio (NWR), or government authorities.

3) Disconnect electrical appliances that aren't necessary. Disconnect all if 
   instructed via WEA/EAS/NWR.

4) Keep cellular and landlines open for emergency personnel. Avoid making 
   unnecessary calls.

5) In a power outage, avoid opening the refrigerator. During cold weather, 
   avoid opening doors or windows; seal gaps in windows and doorframes with
   rolled towels; trap heat in a centralized room using trash bags or sheets;
   keep blinds drawn unless facing the sun. During hot weather, slightly
   open windows and keep internal doors open to circulate air; draw blinds to 
   block sunlight; open windows as much as safely possible after sunset.

6) Use water from taps as little as possible to lighten the load on sanitation 
   systems.

7) The most important element of safety is knowledge and preparation. 
   Make a plan and stick to it!
