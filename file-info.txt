General Information:
--------------------
The term space weather refers to the variable conditions on the sun and in 
Space weather can produce electromagnetic fields that induce extreme currents 
space weather produces solar energetic particles, which can damage satellites 
used for commercial communications, global positioning, intelligence gathering 
and weather forecasting. The sun is the main source of space weather. Sudden 
bursts of plasma and magnetic field structures from the sun's atmosphere called 
coronal mass ejections together with sudden bursts of radiation, or solar 
flares, all cause space weather effects here on Earth.
